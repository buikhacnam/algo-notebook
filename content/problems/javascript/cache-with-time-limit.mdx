## Description

Write a class that allows getting and setting key-value pairs, however a time until expiration is associated with each key.

The class has three public methods:

<code>set(key, value, duration)</code>: accepts an integer <code>key</code>, an integer <code>
	value
</code>
, and a <code>duration</code> in milliseconds. Once the <code>duration</code> has
elapsed, the key should be inaccessible. The method should return <code>
	true
</code> if the same un-expired key already exists and <code>false</code> otherwise.
Both the value and duration should be overwritten if the key already exists.

<code>get(key)</code>: if an un-expired key exists, it should return the
associated value. Otherwise it should return <code>-1</code>.

<code>count()</code>: returns the count of un-expired keys.

Example 1:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: [&quot;TimeLimitedCache&quot;, &quot;set&quot;, &quot;get&quot;,
	&quot;count&quot;, &quot;get&quot;] [[], [1, 42, 100], [1], [], [1]] [0, 0,
	50, 50, 150] Output: [null, false, 42, 1, -1] Explanation: At t=0, the cache
	is constructed. At t=0, a key-value pair (1: 42) is added with a time limit of
	100ms. The value doesn&#39;t exist so false is returned. At t=50, key=1 is
	requested and the value of 42 is returned. At t=50, count() is called and
	there is one active key in the cache. At t=100, key=1 expires. At t=150,
	get(1) is called but -1 is returned because the cache is empty.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: [&quot;TimeLimitedCache&quot;, &quot;set&quot;, &quot;set&quot;,
	&quot;get&quot;, &quot;get&quot;, &quot;get&quot;, &quot;count&quot;] [[], [1,
	42, 50], [1, 50, 100], [1], [1], [1], []] [0, 0, 40, 50, 120, 200, 250]
	Output: [null, false, true, 50, 50, -1, 0] Explanation: At t=0, the cache is
	constructed. At t=0, a key-value pair (1: 42) is added with a time limit of
	50ms. The value doesn&#39;t exist so false is returned. At t=40, a key-value
	pair (1: 50) is added with a time limit of 100ms. A non-expired value already
	existed so true is returned and the old value was overwritten. At t=50, get(1)
	is called which returned 50. At t=120, get(1) is called which returned 50. At
	t=140, key=1 expires. At t=200, get(1) is called but the cache is empty so -1
	is returned. At t=250, count() returns 0 because the cache is empty.
</pre>

Constraints:

    - <code>0 &lt;= key &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
    - <code>0 &lt;= value &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
    - <code>0 &lt;= duration &lt;= 1000</code>
    - total method calls will not exceed 100
