## Description

Write a function that checks if a given value is an instance of a given class or superclass. For this problem, an object is considered an instance of a given class if that object has access to that class&#39;s methods.

There are no constraints on the data types that can be passed to the function. For example, the value or the class could be <code>undefined</code>.

Example 1:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: func = () =&gt; checkIfInstanceOf(new Date(), Date) Output: true
	Explanation: The object returned by the Date constructor is, by definition, an
	instance of Date.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: func = () =&gt; { class Animal {}; class Dog extends Animal {}; return checkIfInstanceOf(new Dog(), Animal); }
Output: true
Explanation:
class Animal {};
class Dog extends Animal {};
checkIfInstanceOf(new Dog(), Animal); // true

Dog is a subclass of Animal. Therefore, a Dog object is an instance of both Dog and Animal.</pre>

Example 3:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: func = () =&gt; checkIfInstanceOf(Date, Date) Output: false
	Explanation: A date constructor cannot logically be an instance of itself.
</pre>

Example 4:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: func = () =&gt; checkIfInstanceOf(5, Number) Output: true Explanation:
	5 is a Number. Note that the &quot;instanceof&quot; keyword would return
	false. However, it is still considered an instance of Number because it
	accesses the Number methods. For example &quot;toFixed()&quot;.
