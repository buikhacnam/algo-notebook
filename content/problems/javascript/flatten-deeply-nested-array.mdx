## Description

Given a multi-dimensional array <code>arr</code> and a depth <code>n</code>, return a flattened version of that array.

A multi-dimensional array is a recursive data structure that contains integers or other multi-dimensional arrays.

A flattened array is a version of that array with some or all of the sub-arrays removed and replaced with the actual elements in that sub-array. This flattening operation should only be done if the current depth of nesting is less than <code>n</code>. The depth of the elements in the first array are considered to be <code>0</code>.

Please solve it without the built-in <code>Array.flat</code> method.

Example 1:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input
arr = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]
n = 0
Output
[1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]

Explanation
Passing a depth of n=0 will always result in the original array. This is because the smallest possible depth of a subarray (0) is not less than n=0. Thus, no subarray should be flattened.

</pre>

Example 2:

<br />

<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input arr = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]] n = 1
	Output [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12, 13, 14, 15] Explanation The
	subarrays starting with 4, 7, and 13 are all flattened. This is because their
	depth of 0 is less than 1. However [9, 10, 11] remains unflattened because its
	depth is 1.
</pre>

Example 3:

<br />

<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input arr = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]] n =
	2 Output [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] Explanation The
	maximum depth of any subarray is 1. Thus, all of them are flattened.
</pre>

Constraints:

    - <code>0 &lt;= count of numbers in arr &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
    - <code>0 &lt;= count of subarrays in arr &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
    - <code>maxDepth &lt;= 1000</code>
    - <code>-1000 &lt;= each number &lt;= 1000</code>
    - <code><font face="monospace">0 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000</font></code>
