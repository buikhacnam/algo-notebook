</Callout>

## Description
Given a function <code>fn</code>, return a new function that is identical to the original function except that it ensures <code>fn</code> is called at most once.


	- The first time the returned function is called, it should return the same result as <code>fn</code>.
	- Every subsequent time it is called, it should return <code>undefined</code>.


 
Example 1:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: fn = (a,b,c) =&gt; (a + b + c), calls = [[1,2,3],[2,3,6]]
Output: [{&quot;calls&quot;:1,&quot;value&quot;:6}]
Explanation:
const onceFn = once(fn);
onceFn(1, 2, 3); // 6
onceFn(2, 3, 6); // undefined, fn was not called
</pre>

Example 2:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: fn = (a,b,c) =&gt; (a * b * c), calls = [[5,7,4],[2,3,6],[4,6,8]]
Output: [{&quot;calls&quot;:1,&quot;value&quot;:140}]
Explanation:
const onceFn = once(fn);
onceFn(5, 7, 4); // 140
onceFn(2, 3, 6); // undefined, fn was not called
onceFn(4, 6, 8); // undefined, fn was not called
</pre>

 
Constraints:


	- <code>1 &lt;= calls.length &lt;= 10</code>
	- <code>1 &lt;= calls[i].length &lt;= 100</code>
	- <code>2 &lt;= JSON.stringify(calls).length &lt;= 1000</code>
