## Description

Write code that enhances all arrays such that you can call the <code>array.groupBy(fn)</code> method on any array and it will return a grouped version of the array.

A grouped array is an object where each key is the output of <code>fn(arr[i])</code> and each value is an array containing all items in the original array with that key.

The provided callback <code>fn</code> will accept an item in the array and return a string key.

The order of each value list should be the order the items appear in the array. Any order of keys is acceptable.

Please solve it without lodash&#39;s <code>\_.groupBy</code> function.

Example 1:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: 
array = [
  {&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},
  {&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1&quot;},
  {&quot;id&quot;:&quot;2&quot;}
], 
fn = function (item) { 
  return item.id; 
}
Output: 
{ 
  &quot;1&quot;: [{&quot;id&quot;: &quot;1&quot;}, {&quot;id&quot;: &quot;1&quot;}],   
  &quot;2&quot;: [{&quot;id&quot;: &quot;2&quot;}] 
}
Explanation:
Output is from array.groupBy(fn).
The selector function gets the &quot;id&quot; out of each item in the array.
There are two objects with an &quot;id&quot; of 1. Both of those objects are put in the first array.
There is one object with an &quot;id&quot; of 2. That object is put in the second array.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: 
array = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [1, 3, 5],
  [1, 5, 9]
]
fn = function (list) { 
  return String(list[0]); 
}
Output: 
{ 
  &quot;1&quot;: [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 5], [1, 5, 9]] 
}
Explanation:
The array can be of any type. In this case, the selector function defines the key as being the first element in the array. 
All the arrays have 1 as their first element so they are grouped together.
{
  &quot;1&quot;: [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 5], [1, 5, 9]]
}
</pre>

Example 3:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: 
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
fn = function (n) { 
  return String(n &gt; 5);
}
Output:
{
  &quot;true&quot;: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
  &quot;false&quot;: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
Explanation:
The selector function splits the array by whether each number is greater than 5.
</pre>

Constraints:

    - <code>0 &lt;= array.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
    - <code>fn returns a string</code>
