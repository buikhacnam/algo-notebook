## Description

Design a system that manages the reservation state of <code>n</code> seats that are numbered from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>.

Implement the <code>SeatManager</code> class:

    - <code>SeatManager(int n)</code> Initializes a <code>SeatManager</code> object that will manage <code>n</code> seats numbered from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. All seats are initially available.
    - <code>int reserve()</code> Fetches the smallest-numbered unreserved seat, reserves it, and returns its number.
    - <code>void unreserve(int seatNumber)</code> Unreserves the seat with the given <code>seatNumber</code>.

Example 1:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input
[&quot;SeatManager&quot;, &quot;reserve&quot;, &quot;reserve&quot;, &quot;unreserve&quot;, &quot;reserve&quot;, &quot;reserve&quot;, &quot;reserve&quot;, &quot;reserve&quot;, &quot;unreserve&quot;]
[[5], [], [], [2], [], [], [], [], [5]]
Output
[null, 1, 2, null, 2, 3, 4, 5, null]

Explanation
SeatManager seatManager = new SeatManager(5); // Initializes a SeatManager with 5 seats.
seatManager.reserve(); // All seats are available, so return the lowest numbered seat, which is 1.
seatManager.reserve(); // The available seats are [2,3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.
seatManager.unreserve(2); // Unreserve seat 2, so now the available seats are [2,3,4,5].
seatManager.reserve(); // The available seats are [2,3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.
seatManager.reserve(); // The available seats are [3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 3.
seatManager.reserve(); // The available seats are [4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 4.
seatManager.reserve(); // The only available seat is seat 5, so return 5.
seatManager.unreserve(5); // Unreserve seat 5, so now the available seats are [5].

</pre>

Constraints:

    - <code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
    - <code>1 &lt;= seatNumber &lt;= n</code>
    - For each call to <code>reserve</code>, it is guaranteed that there will be at least one unreserved seat.
    - For each call to <code>unreserve</code>, it is guaranteed that <code>seatNumber</code> will be reserved.
    - At most <code>10<sup>5</sup></code> calls in total will be made to <code>reserve</code> and <code>unreserve</code>.

### Python

```python
import heapq

class SeatManager:

    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.seats = [i for i in range(1, n + 1)]

    def reserve(self) -> int:
        return heapq.heappop(self.seats)

    def unreserve(self, seatNumber: int) -> None:
        heapq.heappush(self.seats, seatNumber)
```

### C++

```cpp
class SeatManager {
private:
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap;
public:
    SeatManager(int n) {
        for (int i=1; i<=n; ++i)
            minHeap.push(i);
    }

    int reserve() {
        int smallestSeat = minHeap.top();
        minHeap.pop();
        return smallestSeat;
    }

    void unreserve(int seatNumber) {
        minHeap.push(seatNumber);
    }
};

/**
 * Your SeatManager object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * SeatManager* obj = new SeatManager(n);
 * int param_1 = obj->reserve();
 * obj->unreserve(seatNumber);
 */
