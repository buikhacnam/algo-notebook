## Description

You are given <code>n</code>​​​​​​ tasks labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> represented by a 2D integer array <code>tasks</code>, where <code>tasks[i] = [enqueueTime<sub>i</sub>, processingTime<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that the <code>i<sup>​​​​​​th</sup></code>​​​​ task will be available to process at <code>enqueueTime<sub>i</sub></code> and will take <code>processingTime<sub>i</sub></code><sub> </sub>to finish processing.

You have a single-threaded CPU that can process at most one task at a time and will act in the following way:

    - If the CPU is idle and there are no available tasks to process, the CPU remains idle.
    - If the CPU is idle and there are available tasks, the CPU will choose the one with the shortest processing time. If multiple tasks have the same shortest processing time, it will choose the task with the smallest index.
    - Once a task is started, the CPU will process the entire task without stopping.
    - The CPU can finish a task then start a new one instantly.

Return _the order in which the CPU will process the tasks._

Example 1:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: tasks = [[1,2],[2,4],[3,2],[4,1]] Output: [0,2,3,1] Explanation: The
	events go as follows: - At time = 1, task 0 is available to process. Available
	tasks = {0}. - Also at time = 1, the idle CPU starts processing task 0.
	Available tasks = {}. - At time = 2, task 1 is available to process. Available
	tasks = {1}. - At time = 3, task 2 is available to process. Available tasks ={' '}
	{(1, 2)}. - Also at time = 3, the CPU finishes task 0 and starts processing
	task 2 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}. - At time = 4, task 3 is
	available to process. Available tasks = {(1, 3)}. - At time = 5, the CPU
	finishes task 2 and starts processing task 3 as it is the shortest. Available
	tasks = {1}. - At time = 6, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing task
	1. Available tasks = {}. - At time = 10, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes
	idle.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: tasks = [[7,10],[7,12],[7,5],[7,4],[7,2]] Output: [4,3,2,0,1]
	Explanation: The events go as follows: - At time = 7, all the tasks become
	available. Available tasks = {(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)}. - Also at time = 7, the idle
	CPU starts processing task 4. Available tasks = {(0, 1, 2, 3)}. - At time = 9,
	the CPU finishes task 4 and starts processing task 3. Available tasks ={' '}
	{(0, 1, 2)}. - At time = 13, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing
	task 2. Available tasks = {(0, 1)}. - At time = 18, the CPU finishes task 2
	and starts processing task 0. Available tasks = {1}. - At time = 28, the CPU
	finishes task 0 and starts processing task 1. Available tasks = {}. - At time
	= 40, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes idle.
</pre>

Constraints:

    - <code>tasks.length == n</code>
    - <code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
    - <code>1 &lt;= enqueueTime<sub>i</sub>, processingTime<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code>

## Solution

### Javascript

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} tasks
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var getOrder = function (tasks) {
	for (let i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) tasks[i].push(i)
	tasks.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0])
	const pq = new MinPriorityQueue({
		compare: (e1, e2) => {
			if (e1[1] === e2[1]) return e1[2] - e2[2]
			return e1[1] - e2[1]
		},
	})
	const a = []
	let t = tasks[0][0],
		i = 0
	while (pq.size() || i < tasks.length) {
		while (i < tasks.length && t >= tasks[i][0]) {
			pq.enqueue(tasks[i])
			i++
		}
		if (pq.size()) {
			let e = pq.dequeue()
			a.push(e[2])
			t += e[1]
		} else t = tasks[i][0]
	}
	return a
}
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def getOrder(self, tasks: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        tasks = sorted([(t[0], t[1], i) for i, t in enumerate(tasks)])
        result, heap = [], []
        cur_task_index = 0
        cur_time = tasks[0][0]

        while len(result) < len(tasks):
            while (cur_task_index < len(tasks)) and (tasks[cur_task_index][0] <= cur_time):
                heapq.heappush(heap, (tasks[cur_task_index][1], tasks[cur_task_index][2]))
                cur_task_index += 1
            if heap:
                time_difference, original_index = heapq.heappop(heap)
                cur_time += time_difference
                result.append(original_index)
            elif cur_task_index < len(tasks):
                cur_time = tasks[cur_task_index][0]

        return result

```

### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] getOrder(int[][] tasks) {

        // Sort based on min task processing time or min task index.
        PriorityQueue<int[]> nextTask = new PriorityQueue<int[]>((a, b) -> (a[1] != b[1] ? (a[1] - b[1]) : (a[2] - b[2])));

        // Store task enqueue time, processing time, index.
        int sortedTasks[][] = new int[tasks.length][3];
        for (int i = 0; i < tasks.length; ++i) {
            sortedTasks[i][0] = tasks[i][0];
            sortedTasks[i][1] = tasks[i][1];
            sortedTasks[i][2] = i;
        }

        // Sort the tasks based on enqueueTime
        Arrays.sort(sortedTasks, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        int tasksProcessingOrder[] = new int[tasks.length];

        long currTime = 0;
        int taskIndex = 0;
        int ansIndex = 0;

        // Stop when no tasks are left in array and heap.
        while (taskIndex < tasks.length || !nextTask.isEmpty()) {
            if (nextTask.isEmpty() && currTime < sortedTasks[taskIndex][0]) {
                // When the heap is empty, try updating currTime to next task's enqueue time.
                currTime = sortedTasks[taskIndex][0];
            }

            // Push all the tasks whose enqueueTime <= currtTime into the heap.
            while (taskIndex < tasks.length && currTime >= sortedTasks[taskIndex][0]) {
                nextTask.add(sortedTasks[taskIndex]);
                ++taskIndex;
            }

            int[] temp = nextTask.poll();

            // Complete this task and increment currTime.
            currTime += temp[1];
            tasksProcessingOrder[ansIndex++] = temp[2];
        }

        return tasksProcessingOrder;
    }
}
