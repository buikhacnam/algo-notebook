## Description

You are given two integers <code>n</code> and <code>k</code> and two integer arrays <code>speed</code> and <code>efficiency</code> both of length <code>n</code>. There are <code>n</code> engineers numbered from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. <code>speed[i]</code> and <code>efficiency[i]</code> represent the speed and efficiency of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> engineer respectively.

Choose at most <code>k</code> different engineers out of the <code>n</code> engineers to form a team with the maximum performance.

The performance of a team is the sum of its engineers&#39; speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among its engineers.

Return _the maximum performance of this team_. Since the answer can be a huge number, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

Example 1:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2
	Output: 60 Explanation: We have the maximum performance of the team by
	selecting engineer 2 (with speed=10 and efficiency=4) and engineer 5 (with
	speed=5 and efficiency=7). That is, performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 3
	Output: 68 Explanation: This is the same example as the first but k = 3. We
	can select engineer 1, engineer 2 and engineer 5 to get the maximum
	performance of the team. That is, performance = (2 + 10 + 5) * min(5, 4, 7) =
	68.
</pre>

Example 3:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 4
	Output: 72
</pre>

Constraints:

    - <code>1 &lt;= k &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
    - <code>speed.length == n</code>
    - <code>efficiency.length == n</code>
    - <code>1 &lt;= speed[i] &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
    - <code>1 &lt;= efficiency[i] &lt;= 10<sup>8</sup></code>

class Solution:
    def maxPerformance(self, n: int, speed: List[int], efficiency: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
        eng = []
        for eff, spd in zip(efficiency, speed):
            eng.append([eff, spd])
        eng.sort(reverse = True)

        res, speed = 0, 0
        minHeap = []

        for eff, spd in eng:
            if len(minHeap) == k:
                speed -= heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            speed += spd
            heapq.heappush(minHeap, spd)
            res = max(res, eff * speed)
        return res % mod
