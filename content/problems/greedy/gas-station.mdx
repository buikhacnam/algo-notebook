## Description
There are <code>n</code> gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> station is <code>gas[i]</code>.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs <code>cost[i]</code> of gas to travel from the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> station to its next <code>(i + 1)<sup>th</sup></code> station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays <code>gas</code> and <code>cost</code>, return *the starting gas station&#39;s index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return* <code>-1</code>. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique

 
Example 1:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
You can&#39;t start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let&#39;s start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can&#39;t travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
</pre>

 
Constraints:


	- <code>n == gas.length == cost.length</code>
	- <code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
	- <code>0 &lt;= gas[i], cost[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>

### Javascript
```javascript

 * Time: O(n)
 * @param {number[]} gas
 * @param {number[]} cost
 * @return {number}
 */
var canCompleteCircuit = function (gas, cost) {

    //Checks if theres enough gas to complete a cycle
    if (gas.reduce((a, b) => a + b) - cost.reduce((a, b) => a + b) < 0) return -1;

    // Finds the first appearence of a positive netDistance, if the cycle can't
    // be completed (netDistance < 0), starts cycle again @ the next positive netDistance value.
    for (let i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
        netDistance += gas[i] - cost[i];

        if (netDistance < 0) {
            netDistance = 0;

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        total_gas = 0
        remaining_gas = 0
        start_index = 0

        for i in range(len(gas)):
            total_gas += gas[i] - cost[i]
            remaining_gas += gas[i] - cost[i]

            if remaining_gas < 0:
                remaining_gas = 0
                start_index = i + 1

        if total_gas >= 0:
            return start_index
        else:
            return -1

```
### C++
```cpp
/*
    Gas stations along circular route, return where to start to complete 1 trip
    Ex. gas = [1,2,3,4,5] cost = [3,4,5,1,2] -> index 3 (station 4), tank = 4,8,7,6,5

    At a start station, if total ever becomes negative won't work, try next station

    Space: O(1)
