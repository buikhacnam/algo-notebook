## Description
You are playing a video game where you are defending your city from a group of <code>n</code> monsters. You are given a 0-indexed integer array <code>dist</code> of size <code>n</code>, where <code>dist[i]</code> is the initial distance in kilometers of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> monster from the city.

The monsters walk toward the city at a constant speed. The speed of each monster is given to you in an integer array <code>speed</code> of size <code>n</code>, where <code>speed[i]</code> is the speed of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> monster in kilometers per minute.

You have a weapon that, once fully charged, can eliminate a single monster. However, the weapon takes one minute to charge.The weapon is fully charged at the very start.

You lose when any monster reaches your city. If a monster reaches the city at the exact moment the weapon is fully charged, it counts as a loss, and the game ends before you can use your weapon.

Return *the maximum number of monsters that you can eliminate before you lose, or *<code>n</code>* if you can eliminate all the monsters before they reach the city.*

 
Example 1:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: dist = [1,3,4], speed = [1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation:
In the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [1,3,4]. You eliminate the first monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,2,3]. You eliminate the second monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,X,2]. You eliminate the thrid monster.
All 3 monsters can be eliminated.</pre>

Example 2:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: dist = [1,1,2,3], speed = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
In the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [1,1,2,3]. You eliminate the first monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,0,1,2], so you lose.
You can only eliminate 1 monster.
</pre>

Example 3:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: dist = [3,2,4], speed = [5,3,2]
Output: 1
Explanation:
In the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [3,2,4]. You eliminate the first monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,0,2], so you lose.
You can only eliminate 1 monster.
</pre>

 
Constraints:


	- <code>n == dist.length == speed.length</code>
	- <code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
	- <code>1 &lt;= dist[i], speed[i] &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>

/*
  You are playing a video game where you are defending your city from a group of n monsters. 
  You are given a 0-indexed integer array dist of size n, where dist[i] is the initial distance in kilometers of the ith monster from the city.
  The monsters walk toward the city at a constant speed. The speed of each monster is given to you in an integer array speed of size n, 
  where speed[i] is the speed of the ith monster in kilometers per minute.
  You have a weapon that, once fully charged, can eliminate a single monster. 
  However, the weapon takes one minute to charge.The weapon is fully charged at the very start.
  You lose when any monster reaches your city. If a monster reaches the city at the exact moment the weapon is fully charged, 
  it counts as a loss, and the game ends before you can use your weapon.
  
  Return the maximum number of monsters that you can eliminate before you lose, or n if you can eliminate all the monsters before they reach the city. 

  Ex. Input: dist = [1,3,4], speed = [1,1,1]
      Output: 3
      Explanation:
      In the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [1,3,4]. You eliminate the first monster.
      After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,2,3]. You eliminate the second monster.
      After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,X,2]. You eliminate the thrid monster.
      All 3 monsters can be eliminated.
