## Description

There are several cards arranged in a row, and each card has an associated number of points. The points are given in the integer array <code>cardPoints</code>.

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly <code>k</code> cards.

Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.

Given the integer array <code>cardPoints</code> and the integer <code>k</code>, return the _maximum score_ you can obtain.

Example 1:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3 Output: 12 Explanation: After the
	first step, your score will always be 1. However, choosing the rightmost card
	first will maximize your total score. The optimal strategy is to take the
	three cards on the right, giving a final score of 1 + 6 + 5 = 12.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2 Output: 4 Explanation: Regardless of which
	two cards you take, your score will always be 4.
</pre>

Example 3:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: cardPoints = [9,7,7,9,7,7,9], k = 7 Output: 55 Explanation: You have to
	take all the cards. Your score is the sum of points of all cards.
</pre>

Constraints:

    - <code>1 &lt;= cardPoints.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
    - <code>1 &lt;= cardPoints[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
    - <code>1 &lt;= k &lt;= cardPoints.length</code>
