## Description
On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at <code>(0, 0)</code> and faces north. Note that:


	- The north direction is the positive direction of the y-axis.
	- The south direction is the negative direction of the y-axis.
	- The east direction is the positive direction of the x-axis.
	- The west direction is the negative direction of the x-axis.


The robot can receive one of three instructions:


	- <code>&quot;G&quot;</code>: go straight 1 unit.
	- <code>&quot;L&quot;</code>: turn 90 degrees to the left (i.e., anti-clockwise direction).
	- <code>&quot;R&quot;</code>: turn 90 degrees to the right (i.e., clockwise direction).


The robot performs the <code>instructions</code> given in order, and repeats them forever.

Return <code>true</code> if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

 
Example 1:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: instructions = &quot;GGLLGG&quot;
Output: true
Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
&quot;G&quot;: move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
&quot;G&quot;: move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.
&quot;L&quot;: turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: West.
&quot;L&quot;: turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: South.
&quot;G&quot;: move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: South.
&quot;G&quot;: move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: South.
Repeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --&gt; (0, 1) --&gt; (0, 2) --&gt; (0, 1) --&gt; (0, 0).
Based on that, we return true.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: instructions = &quot;GG&quot;
Output: false
Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
&quot;G&quot;: move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
&quot;G&quot;: move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.
Repeating the instructions, keeps advancing in the north direction and does not go into cycles.
Based on that, we return false.
</pre>

Example 3:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: instructions = &quot;GL&quot;
Output: true
Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
&quot;G&quot;: move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
&quot;L&quot;: turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 1). Direction: West.
&quot;G&quot;: move one step. Position: (-1, 1). Direction: West.
&quot;L&quot;: turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (-1, 1). Direction: South.
&quot;G&quot;: move one step. Position: (-1, 0). Direction: South.
&quot;L&quot;: turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (-1, 0). Direction: East.
&quot;G&quot;: move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: East.
&quot;L&quot;: turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 0). Direction: North.
Repeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --&gt; (0, 1) --&gt; (-1, 1) --&gt; (-1, 0) --&gt; (0, 0).
Based on that, we return true.
</pre>

 
Constraints:


	- <code>1 &lt;= instructions.length &lt;= 100</code>
