## Description

You are given two strings <code>s</code> and <code>p</code> where <code>p</code> is a subsequence of <code>s</code>. You are also given a distinct 0-indexed integer array <code>removable</code> containing a subset of indices of <code>s</code> (<code>s</code> is also 0-indexed).

You want to choose an integer <code>k</code> (<code>0 &lt;= k &lt;= removable.length</code>) such that, after removing <code>k</code> characters from <code>s</code> using the first <code>k</code> indices in <code>removable</code>, <code>p</code> is still a subsequence of <code>s</code>. More formally, you will mark the character at <code>s[removable[i]]</code> for each <code>0 &lt;= i &lt; k</code>, then remove all marked characters and check if <code>p</code> is still a subsequence.

Return _the maximum _<code>k</code>_ you can choose such that _<code>p</code>_ is still a subsequence of _<code>s</code>_ after the removals_.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

Example 1:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: s = &quot;abcacb&quot;, p = &quot;ab&quot;, removable = [3,1,0] Output:
	2 Explanation: After removing the characters at indices 3 and 1, &quot;a
	<s>b</s>c<s>a</s>cb&quot; becomes &quot;accb&quot;. &quot;ab&quot; is a
	subsequence of &quot;<u>a</u>cc<u>b</u>&quot;. If we remove the characters at
	indices 3, 1, and 0, &quot;<s>ab</s>c<s>a</s>cb&quot; becomes &quot;ccb&quot;,
	and &quot;ab&quot; is no longer a subsequence. Hence, the maximum k is 2.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: s = &quot;abcbddddd&quot;, p = &quot;abcd&quot;, removable =
	[3,2,1,4,5,6] Output: 1 Explanation: After removing the character at index 3,
	&quot;abc<s>b</s>ddddd&quot; becomes &quot;abcddddd&quot;. &quot;abcd&quot; is
	a subsequence of &quot;<u>abcd</u>dddd&quot;.
</pre>

Example 3:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: s = &quot;abcab&quot;, p = &quot;abc&quot;, removable = [0,1,2,3,4]
	Output: 0 Explanation: If you remove the first index in the array removable,
	&quot;abc&quot; is no longer a subsequence.
</pre>

Constraints:

    - <code>1 &lt;= p.length &lt;= s.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
    - <code>0 &lt;= removable.length &lt; s.length</code>
    - <code>0 &lt;= removable[i] &lt; s.length</code>
    - <code>p</code> is a subsequence of <code>s</code>.
    - <code>s</code> and <code>p</code> both consist of lowercase English letters.
    - The elements in <code>removable</code> are distinct.
