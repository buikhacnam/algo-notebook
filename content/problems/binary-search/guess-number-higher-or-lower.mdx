## Description

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API <code>int guess(int num)</code>, which returns three possible results:

    - <code>-1</code>: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. <code>num &gt; pick</code>).
    - <code>1</code>: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. <code>num &lt; pick</code>).
    - <code>0</code>: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. <code>num == pick</code>).

Return _the number that I picked_.

Example 1:

<br />

<pre className="overflow-x-auto">Input: n = 10, pick = 6 Output: 6</pre>

Example 2:

<br />

<pre className="overflow-x-auto">Input: n = 1, pick = 1 Output: 1</pre>

Example 3:

<br />

<pre className="overflow-x-auto">Input: n = 2, pick = 1 Output: 1</pre>

Constraints:

    - <code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>
    - <code>1 &lt;= pick &lt;= n</code>

## Solution

### Javascript

```javascript
var guessNumber = function (n) {
	let low = 1
	let high = n

	while (true) {
		let mid = low + Math.floor((high - low) / 2)
		let myGuess = guess(mid)
		if (myGuess == 1) low = mid + 1
		else if (myGuess == -1) high = mid - 1
		else return mid
	}
}
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        # return a num btw 1,..,n

        low = 1
        high = n

        while True:
            mid = low + (high - low) // 2
            myGuess = guess(mid)
            if myGuess == 1:
                low = mid + 1
            elif myGuess == -1:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                return mid

```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = n;

        while(true) {
            int mid = low + (high - low)/2;
            int myGuess = guess(mid);
            if(myGuess == 1)
                low = mid + 1;
            else if(myGuess == -1)
                high = mid - 1;
            else
                return mid;
        }
    }
};

```

### Java

```java
public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        //return a num between 1,...,n
        int low = 1;
        int high = n;

        while(true) {
            int mid = low + (high - low)/2;
            int myGuess = guess(mid);
            if(myGuess == 1)
                low = mid + 1;
            else if(myGuess == -1)
                high = mid - 1;
            else
                return mid;
        }
    }
}

```
