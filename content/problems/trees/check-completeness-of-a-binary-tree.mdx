## Description
Given the <code>root</code> of a binary tree, determine if it is a *complete binary tree*.

In a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees" target="_blank">complete binary tree</a>, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between <code>1</code> and <code>2<sup>h</sup></code> nodes inclusive at the last level <code>h</code>.

 
Example 1:
<Image alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-1.png" width={180} height={145} />
<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
</pre>

Example 2:
<Image alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-2.png" width={200} height={145} />
<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The node with value 7 isn&#39;t as far left as possible.
</pre>

 
Constraints:


	- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[1, 100]</code>.
	- <code>1 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 1000</code>

  Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

  In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled,
  and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h
  nodes inclusive at the last level h.

  Ex. Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
      Output: true
      Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), 
      and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
