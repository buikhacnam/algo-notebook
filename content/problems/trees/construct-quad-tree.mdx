## Description
Given a <code>n * n</code> matrix <code>grid</code> of <code>0&#39;s</code> and <code>1&#39;s</code> only. We want to represent <code>grid</code> with a Quad-Tree.

Return *the root of the Quad-Tree representing *<code>grid</code>.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:


	- <code>val</code>: True if the node represents a grid of 1&#39;s or False if the node represents a grid of 0&#39;s. Notice that you can assign the <code>val</code> to True or False when <code>isLeaf</code> is False, and both are accepted in the answer.
	- <code>isLeaf</code>: True if the node is a leaf node on the tree or False if the node has four children.


<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}</pre>

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

<ol>
	- If the current grid has the same value (i.e all <code>1&#39;s</code> or all <code>0&#39;s</code>) set <code>isLeaf</code> True and set <code>val</code> to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
	- If the current grid has different values, set <code>isLeaf</code> to False and set <code>val</code> to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
	- Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.
</ol>

Quad-Tree format:

You don&#39;t need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where <code>null</code> signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list <code>[isLeaf, val]</code>.

If the value of <code>isLeaf</code> or <code>val</code> is True we represent it as 1 in the list <code>[isLeaf, val]</code> and if the value of <code>isLeaf</code> or <code>val</code> is False we represent it as 0.

 
Example 1:
<Image alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/11/grid1.png" width={777} height={99} />
<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:
Notice that 0 represents False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.

Example 2:

<Image alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/12/e2mat.png" width={777} height={343} />

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
Explanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.
The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.
The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.

Constraints:


	- <code>n == grid.length == grid[i].length</code>
	- <code>n == 2<sup>x</sup></code> where <code>0 &lt;= x &lt;= 6</code>
