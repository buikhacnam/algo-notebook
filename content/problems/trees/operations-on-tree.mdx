## Description
You are given a tree with <code>n</code> nodes numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> in the form of a parent array <code>parent</code> where <code>parent[i]</code> is the parent of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> node. The root of the tree is node <code>0</code>, so <code>parent[0] = -1</code> since it has no parent. You want to design a data structure that allows users to lock, unlock, and upgrade nodes in the tree.

The data structure should support the following functions:


	- Lock: Locks the given node for the given user and prevents other users from locking the same node. You may only lock a node using this function if the node is unlocked.
	- Unlock: Unlocks the given node for the given user. You may only unlock a node using this function if it is currently locked by the same user.
	- <b>Upgrade</b>: Locks the given node for the given user and unlocks all of its descendants regardless of who locked it. You may only upgrade a node if all 3 conditions are true:
	
		- The node is unlocked,
		- It has at least one locked descendant (by any user), and
		- It does not have any locked ancestors.
	
	


Implement the <code>LockingTree</code> class:


	- <code>LockingTree(int[] parent)</code> initializes the data structure with the parent array.
	- <code>lock(int num, int user)</code> returns <code>true</code> if it is possible for the user with id <code>user</code> to lock the node <code>num</code>, or <code>false</code> otherwise. If it is possible, the node <code>num</code> will become locked by the user with id <code>user</code>.
	- <code>unlock(int num, int user)</code> returns <code>true</code> if it is possible for the user with id <code>user</code> to unlock the node <code>num</code>, or <code>false</code> otherwise. If it is possible, the node <code>num</code> will become unlocked.
	- <code>upgrade(int num, int user)</code> returns <code>true</code> if it is possible for the user with id <code>user</code> to upgrade the node <code>num</code>, or <code>false</code> otherwise. If it is possible, the node <code>num</code> will be upgraded.

Input
[&quot;LockingTree&quot;, &quot;lock&quot;, &quot;unlock&quot;, &quot;unlock&quot;, &quot;lock&quot;, &quot;upgrade&quot;, &quot;lock&quot;]
[[[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 2], [4, 5], [0, 1], [0, 1]]
Output
[null, true, false, true, true, true, false]

Explanation
LockingTree lockingTree = new LockingTree([-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]);
lockingTree.lock(2, 2);    // return true because node 2 is unlocked.
                           // Node 2 will now be locked by user 2.
lockingTree.unlock(2, 3);  // return false because user 3 cannot unlock a node locked by user 2.
lockingTree.unlock(2, 2);  // return true because node 2 was previously locked by user 2.
                           // Node 2 will now be unlocked.
lockingTree.lock(4, 5);    // return true because node 4 is unlocked.
                           // Node 4 will now be locked by user 5.
lockingTree.upgrade(0, 1); // return true because node 0 is unlocked and has at least one locked descendant (node 4).
                           // Node 0 will now be locked by user 1 and node 4 will now be unlocked.
lockingTree.lock(0, 1);    // return false because node 0 is already locked.
</pre>

 
Constraints:


	- <code>n == parent.length</code>
	- <code>2 &lt;= n &lt;= 2000</code>
	- <code>0 &lt;= parent[i] &lt;= n - 1</code> for <code>i != 0</code>
	- <code>parent[0] == -1</code>
	- <code>0 &lt;= num &lt;= n - 1</code>
	- <code>1 &lt;= user &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
	- <code>parent</code> represents a valid tree.
	- At most <code>2000</code> calls in total will be made to <code>lock</code>, <code>unlock</code>, and <code>upgrade</code>.
