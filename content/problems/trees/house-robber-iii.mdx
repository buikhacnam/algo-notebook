## Description

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called <code>root</code>.

Besides the <code>root</code>, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Given the <code>root</code> of the binary tree, return _the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police_.

	src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/rob1-tree.jpg"
	width={277}
	height={293}
/>
<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1] Output: 7 Explanation: Maximum amount of
	money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
</pre>

Example 2:

<Image
	alt=""
	src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/rob2-tree.jpg"
	width={357}
	height={293}
/>
<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1] Output: 9 Explanation: Maximum amount of
	money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
</pre>

Constraints:

    - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[1, 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.
    - <code>0 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>

        int []res = new int[2];

        res[0] = left[1] + right[1] + root.val; //with Root
        res[1] = Math.max(left[0], left[1]) + Math.max(right[0], right[1]); //without Root

        return res;
    }
    public int rob(TreeNode root) {
        int []ans = dfs(root);
        return Math.max(ans[0], ans[1]);
    }
