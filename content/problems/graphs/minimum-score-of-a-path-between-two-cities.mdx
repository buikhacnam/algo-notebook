## Description
You are given a positive integer <code>n</code> representing <code>n</code> cities numbered from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. You are also given a 2D array <code>roads</code> where <code>roads[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, distance<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> with a distance equal to <code>distance<sub>i</sub></code>. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.

The score of a path between two cities is defined as the minimum distance of a road in this path.

Return *the minimum possible score of a path between cities *<code>1</code>* and *<code>n</code>.

Note:


	- A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
	- It is allowed for a path to contain the same road multiple times, and you can visit cities <code>1</code> and <code>n</code> multiple times along the path.
	- The test cases are generated such that there is at least one path between <code>1</code> and <code>n</code>.


 
Example 1:
<Image alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/12/graph11.png" width={190} height={231} />
<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,9],[2,3,6],[2,4,5],[1,4,7]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4. The score of this path is min(9,5) = 5.
It can be shown that no other path has less score.
</pre>

Example 2:
<Image alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/12/graph22.png" width={190} height={231} />
<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,2],[1,3,4],[3,4,7]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4. The score of this path is min(2,2,4,7) = 2.
</pre>

 
Constraints:


	- <code>2 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
	- <code>1 &lt;= roads.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
	- <code>roads[i].length == 3</code>
	- <code>1 &lt;= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> &lt;= n</code>
	- <code>a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub></code>
	- <code>1 &lt;= distance<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
	- There are no repeated edges.
	- There is at least one path between <code>1</code> and <code>n</code>.
