## Description
There are <code>n</code> oranges in the kitchen and you decided to eat some of these oranges every day as follows:


	- Eat one orange.
	- If the number of remaining oranges <code>n</code> is divisible by <code>2</code> then you can eat <code>n / 2</code> oranges.
	- If the number of remaining oranges <code>n</code> is divisible by <code>3</code> then you can eat <code>2 * (n / 3)</code> oranges.


You can only choose one of the actions per day.

Given the integer <code>n</code>, return *the minimum number of days to eat* <code>n</code> *oranges*.

 
Example 1:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: You have 10 oranges.
Day 1: Eat 1 orange,  10 - 1 = 9.  
Day 2: Eat 6 oranges, 9 - 2*(9/3) = 9 - 6 = 3. (Since 9 is divisible by 3)
Day 3: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. 
Day 4: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.
You need at least 4 days to eat the 10 oranges.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: n = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: You have 6 oranges.
Day 1: Eat 3 oranges, 6 - 6/2 = 6 - 3 = 3. (Since 6 is divisible by 2).
Day 2: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. (Since 3 is divisible by 3)
Day 3: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.
You need at least 3 days to eat the 6 oranges.
</pre>

 
Constraints:


	- <code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 2 * 10<sup>9</sup></code>
