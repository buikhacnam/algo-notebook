## Description

You are given a list of bombs. The range of a bomb is defined as the area where its effect can be felt. This area is in the shape of a circle with the center as the location of the bomb.

The bombs are represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array <code>bombs</code> where <code>bombs[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>]</code>. <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>y<sub>i</sub></code> denote the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of the location of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> bomb, whereas <code>r<sub>i</sub></code> denotes the radius of its range.

You may choose to detonate a single bomb. When a bomb is detonated, it will detonate all bombs that lie in its range. These bombs will further detonate the bombs that lie in their ranges.

Given the list of <code>bombs</code>, return _the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated if you are allowed to detonate only one bomb_.

Example 1:

	width={300}
	height={300}
/>
<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: bombs = [[2,1,3],[6,1,4]] Output: 2 Explanation: The above figure shows
	the positions and ranges of the 2 bombs. If we detonate the left bomb, the
	right bomb will not be affected. But if we detonate the right bomb, both bombs
	will be detonated. So the maximum bombs that can be detonated is max(1, 2) =
	2.
</pre>

Example 2:

	width={300}
	height={300}
/>
<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: bombs = [[1,1,5],[10,10,5]] Output: 1 Explanation: Detonating either
	bomb will not detonate the other bomb, so the maximum number of bombs that can
	be detonated is 1.
</pre>

Example 3:

	height={300}

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: bombs = [[1,2,3],[2,3,1],[3,4,2],[4,5,3],[5,6,4]] Output: 5
	Explanation: The best bomb to detonate is bomb 0 because: - Bomb 0 detonates
	bombs 1 and 2. The red circle denotes the range of bomb 0. - Bomb 2 detonates
	bomb 3. The blue circle denotes the range of bomb 2. - Bomb 3 detonates bomb
	4. The green circle denotes the range of bomb 3. Thus all 5 bombs are
	detonated.
</pre>

Constraints:

    - <code>1 &lt;= bombs.length &lt;= 100</code>
    - <code>bombs[i].length == 3</code>
    - <code>1 &lt;= x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
