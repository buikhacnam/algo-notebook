## Description

You are given a directed graph of <code>n</code> nodes numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>, where each node has at most one outgoing edge.

The graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array <code>edges</code> of size <code>n</code>, indicating that there is a directed edge from node <code>i</code> to node <code>edges[i]</code>. If there is no outgoing edge from <code>i</code>, then <code>edges[i] == -1</code>.

You are also given two integers <code>node1</code> and <code>node2</code>.

Return _the index of the node that can be reached from both _<code>node1</code>_ and _<code>node2</code>_, such that the maximum between the distance from _<code>node1</code>_ to that node, and from _<code>node2</code>_ to that node is minimized_. If there are multiple answers, return the node with the smallest index, and if no possible answer exists, return <code>-1</code>.

Note that <code>edges</code> may contain cycles.

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: edges = [2,2,3,-1], node1 = 0, node2 = 1 Output: 2 Explanation: The
	distance from node 0 to node 2 is 1, and the distance from node 1 to node 2 is
	1. The maximum of those two distances is 1. It can be proven that we cannot
	get a node with a smaller maximum distance than 1, so we return node 2.
</pre>

Example 2:

	src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/07/graph4drawio-4.png"
	width={195}
	height={161}
/>
<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: edges = [1,2,-1], node1 = 0, node2 = 2 Output: 2 Explanation: The
	distance from node 0 to node 2 is 2, and the distance from node 2 to itself is
	0. The maximum of those two distances is 2. It can be proven that we cannot
	get a node with a smaller maximum distance than 2, so we return node 2.
</pre>

Constraints:

    - <code>n == edges.length</code>
    - <code>2 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
    - <code>-1 &lt;= edges[i] &lt; n</code>
    - <code>edges[i] != i</code>
    - <code>0 &lt;= node1, node2 &lt; n</code>
