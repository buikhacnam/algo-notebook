## Description

Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of &#39;1&#39; bits it has (also known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight" target="_blank">Hamming weight</a>).

Note:

    - Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer&#39;s internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
    - In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement" target="_blank">2&#39;s complement notation</a>. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. <code>-3</code>.

Example 1:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011 Output: 3 Explanation: The input
	binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three
	&#39;1&#39; bits.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000 Output: 1 Explanation: The input
	binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one &#39;1&#39;
	bit.
</pre>

Example 3:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101 Output: 31 Explanation: The input
	binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one
	&#39;1&#39; bits.
</pre>

Constraints:

    - The input must be a binary string of length <code>32</code>.

Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

## Solution

### Javascript

```javascript
/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/
 * Time O(1) | Space (1)
 * @param {number} n - a positive integer
 * @return {number}
 */
var hammingWeight = function (n) {
	let [bits, mask] = [0, 1]

	for (let i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
		const hasBit = (n & mask) !== 0
		if (hasBit) bits++

		mask <<= 1
	}

	return bits
}

/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/
 * Time O(1) | Space (1)
 * @param {number} n - a positive integer
 * @return {number}
 */
var hammingWeight = function (n, sum = 0) {
	while (n !== 0) {
		n &= n - 1
		sum++
	}

	return sum
}
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        while n:
            n &= n - 1
            res += 1
        return res

```

### C++

```cpp
/*
    Return number of '1' bits in an int
    Ex. n = 00001011 -> 3

    Simply count bit-by-bit & shift it off

    Time: O(1)
    Space: O(1)
*/

class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int bit = 0;
        int result = 0;

        while (n != 0) {
            bit = n & 1;
            if (bit == 1) {
                result++;
            }
            n = n >> 1;
        }

        return result;
    }
};

```

### Java

```java
//standard way
public class Solution {

    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        int mask = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if ((n & mask) != 0) {
                count++;
            }
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}

//smart way
public class Solution {

    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            n = n & (n - 1);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}

```
