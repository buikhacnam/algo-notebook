## Description

There is a group of <code>n</code> members, and a list of various crimes they could commit. The <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> crime generates a <code>profit[i]</code> and requires <code>group[i]</code> members to participate in it. If a member participates in one crime, that member can&#39;t participate in another crime.

Let&#39;s call a profitable scheme any subset of these crimes that generates at least <code>minProfit</code> profit, and the total number of members participating in that subset of crimes is at most <code>n</code>.

Return the number of schemes that can be chosen. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

Example 1:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: n = 5, minProfit = 3, group = [2,2], profit = [2,3] Output: 2
	Explanation: To make a profit of at least 3, the group could either commit
	crimes 0 and 1, or just crime 1. In total, there are 2 schemes.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: n = 10, minProfit = 5, group = [2,3,5], profit = [6,7,8] Output: 7
	Explanation: To make a profit of at least 5, the group could commit any
	crimes, as long as they commit one. There are 7 possible schemes: (0), (1),
	(2), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), and (0,1,2).
</pre>

Constraints:

    - <code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100</code>
    - <code>0 &lt;= minProfit &lt;= 100</code>
    - <code>1 &lt;= group.length &lt;= 100</code>
    - <code>1 &lt;= group[i] &lt;= 100</code>
    - <code>profit.length == group.length</code>
    - <code>0 &lt;= profit[i] &lt;= 100</code>
