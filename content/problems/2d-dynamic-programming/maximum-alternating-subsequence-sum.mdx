## Description
The alternating sum of a 0-indexed array is defined as the sum of the elements at even indices minus the sum of the elements at odd indices.


	- For example, the alternating sum of <code>[4,2,5,3]</code> is <code>(4 + 5) - (2 + 3) = 4</code>.


Given an array <code>nums</code>, return *the maximum alternating sum of any subsequence of *<code>nums</code>* (after reindexing the elements of the subsequence)*.




A subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements&#39; relative order. For example, <code>[2,7,4]</code> is a subsequence of <code>[4,<u>2</u>,3,<u>7</u>,2,1,<u>4</u>]</code> (the underlined elements), while <code>[2,4,2]</code> is not.

 
Example 1:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: nums = [<u>4</u>,<u>2</u>,<u>5</u>,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: It is optimal to choose the subsequence [4,2,5] with alternating sum (4 + 5) - 2 = 7.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: nums = [5,6,7,<u>8</u>]
Output: 8
Explanation: It is optimal to choose the subsequence [8] with alternating sum 8.
</pre>

Example 3:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: nums = [<u>6</u>,2,<u>1</u>,2,4,<u>5</u>]
Output: 10
Explanation: It is optimal to choose the subsequence [6,1,5] with alternating sum (6 + 5) - 1 = 10.
</pre>

 
Constraints:


	- <code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
	- <code>1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>

/*
Given an array nums, return the maximum alternating sum of any subsequence of nums (after reindexing the elements of the subsequence).
The alternating sum of a 0-indexed array is defined as the sum of the elements at even indices minus the sum of the elements at odd indices.
For example, the alternating sum of [4,2,5,3] is (4 + 5) - (2 + 3) = 4.

Example. Let nums = [6,2,1,2,4,5].
         The subsequence {6,1,5} can be choosen which gives maximum alternating sum of (6 + 5) - 1 = 10, which is the optimal solution in this case.
	 So we return 10 as our answer.
