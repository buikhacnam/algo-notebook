## Description
There are <code>n</code> uniquely-sized sticks whose lengths are integers from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. You want to arrange the sticks such that exactly <code>k</code> sticks are visible from the left. A stick is visible from the left if there are no longer sticks to the left of it.


	- For example, if the sticks are arranged <code>[<u>1</u>,<u>3</u>,2,<u>5</u>,4]</code>, then the sticks with lengths <code>1</code>, <code>3</code>, and <code>5</code> are visible from the left.


Given <code>n</code> and <code>k</code>, return *the number of such arrangements*. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

 
Example 1:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: [<u>1</u>,<u>3</u>,2], [<u>2</u>,<u>3</u>,1], and [<u>2</u>,1,<u>3</u>] are the only arrangements such that exactly 2 sticks are visible.
The visible sticks are underlined.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: n = 5, k = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: [<u>1</u>,<u>2</u>,<u>3</u>,<u>4</u>,<u>5</u>] is the only arrangement such that all 5 sticks are visible.
The visible sticks are underlined.
</pre>

Example 3:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: n = 20, k = 11
Output: 647427950
Explanation: There are 647427950 (mod 10<sup>9 </sup>+ 7) ways to rearrange the sticks such that exactly 11 sticks are visible.
</pre>

 
Constraints:


	- <code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000</code>
	- <code>1 &lt;= k &lt;= n</code>
