## Description

Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are a number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones <code>piles[i]</code>. The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. Initially, <code>M = 1</code>.

On each player&#39;s turn, that player can take all the stones in the first <code>X</code> remaining piles, where <code>1 &lt;= X &lt;= 2M</code>. Then, we set <code>M = max(M, X)</code>.

The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alice can get.

Example 1:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: piles = [2,7,9,4,4] Output: 10 Explanation: If Alice takes one pile at
	the beginning, Bob takes two piles, then Alice takes 2 piles again. Alice can
	get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total. If Alice takes two piles at the beginning,
	then Bob can take all three piles left. In this case, Alice get 2 + 7 = 9
	piles in total. So we return 10 since it&#39;s larger.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: piles = [1,2,3,4,5,100] Output: 104
</pre>

Constraints:

    - <code>1 &lt;= piles.length &lt;= 100</code>
    - <code>1 &lt;= piles[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
