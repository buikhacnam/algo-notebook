## Description
Given the integers <code>zero</code>, <code>one</code>, <code>low</code>, and <code>high</code>, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:


	- Append the character <code>&#39;0&#39;</code> <code>zero</code> times.
	- Append the character <code>&#39;1&#39;</code> <code>one</code> times.


This can be performed any number of times.

A good string is a string constructed by the above process having a length between <code>low</code> and <code>high</code> (inclusive).

Return *the number of different good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties.* Since the answer can be large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

 
Example 1:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: low = 3, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 1
Output: 8
Explanation: 
One possible valid good string is &quot;011&quot;. 
It can be constructed as follows: &quot;&quot; -&gt; &quot;0&quot; -&gt; &quot;01&quot; -&gt; &quot;011&quot;. 
All binary strings from &quot;000&quot; to &quot;111&quot; are good strings in this example.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: low = 2, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The good strings are &quot;00&quot;, &quot;11&quot;, &quot;000&quot;, &quot;110&quot;, and &quot;011&quot;.
</pre>

 
Constraints:


	- <code>1 &lt;= low &lt;= high &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
	- <code>1 &lt;= zero, one &lt;= low</code>
