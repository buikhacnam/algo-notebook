## Description

You are given an integer array <code>nums</code>. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

    - Pick any <code>nums[i]</code> and delete it to earn <code>nums[i]</code> points. Afterwards, you must delete <b>every</b> element equal to <code>nums[i] - 1</code> and every element equal to <code>nums[i] + 1</code>.

Return _the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times_.

Example 1:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: nums = [3,4,2] Output: 6 Explanation: You can perform the following
	operations: - Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums
	= [2]. - Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = []. You earn a total of 6 points.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4] Output: 9 Explanation: You can perform the
	following operations: - Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2&#39;s and 4&#39;s
	are also deleted. nums = [3,3]. - Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums =
	[3]. - Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = []. You earn a total of 9
	points.
</pre>

Constraints:

    - <code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
    - <code>1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>

### Python

```python
# House Robber Style
# Time Complexity O(n)
# Space Complexity O(n)
class Solution(object):
    def deleteAndEarn(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """

        upperLimit = max(nums) + 1
        store = [0] * upperLimit

        for num in nums:
            store[num] += num

        dp = [0] * upperLimit

        dp[1] = 1 * store[1]
        for i in range(2, upperLimit):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 2] + store[i], dp[i - 1])

        return dp[-1]
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxnum=0;
        int trans[10001]={0};
        for(int i:nums){
            trans[i]+=i;
            maxnum=max(maxnum,i);
        }
        int dp[maxnum+1];
        dp[0]=trans[0];
        dp[1]=max(trans[1],trans[0]);
        for(int i=2;i<=maxnum;i++){
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] +trans[i]);
        }
        return dp[maxnum];
    }
