## Description

You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in which you will travel are given as an integer array <code>days</code>. Each day is an integer from <code>1</code> to <code>365</code>.

Train tickets are sold in three different ways:

    - a 1-day pass is sold for <code>costs[0]</code> dollars,
    - a 7-day pass is sold for <code>costs[1]</code> dollars, and
    - a 30-day pass is sold for <code>costs[2]</code> dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.

    - For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day <code>2</code>, then we can travel for <code>7</code> days: <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>7</code>, and <code>8</code>.

Return _the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days_.

Example 1:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15] Output: 11 Explanation: For
	example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
	On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1. On
	day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4,
	..., 9. On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered
	day 20. In total, you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br />
<pre className="overflow-x-auto">
	Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15] Output: 17
	Explanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel
	your travel plan: On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which
	covered days 1, 2, ..., 30. On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] =
	$2 which covered day 31. In total, you spent $17 and covered all the days of
	your travel.
</pre>

Constraints:

    - <code>1 &lt;= days.length &lt;= 365</code>
    - <code>1 &lt;= days[i] &lt;= 365</code>
    - <code>days</code> is in strictly increasing order.
    - <code>costs.length == 3</code>
    - <code>1 &lt;= costs[i] &lt;= 1000</code>

/*
The days of the year in which you will travel are given as an integer array days. Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.

Train tickets are sold in three different ways:

a 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars,
a 7-day pass is sold for costs[1] dollars, and
a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.
The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.

Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.


Example. For days = [1,4,6,7,8,20] and costs = [2,7,15] we can buy a 1-day pass
	 for costs[0] = $2, which covers day 1. On day 3 we can buy a 7-day pass
	 for costs[1] = $7, which covers days 3,4....9. On day 20 we can again buy a
	 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 that will cover the 20th day. So in total we spent
	 2 + 7 + 2 = $11 which is the minimum dollars needed for travelling in this case.
