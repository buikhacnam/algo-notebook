## Description
You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array <code>questions</code> where <code>questions[i] = [points<sub>i</sub>, brainpower<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

The array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions in order (i.e., starting from question <code>0</code>) and make a decision whether to solve or skip each question. Solving question <code>i</code> will earn you <code>points<sub>i</sub></code> points but you will be unable to solve each of the next <code>brainpower<sub>i</sub></code> questions. If you skip question <code>i</code>, you get to make the decision on the next question.


	- For example, given <code>questions = [[3, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [2, 5]]</code>:

	
		- If question <code>0</code> is solved, you will earn <code>3</code> points but you will be unable to solve questions <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>.
		- If instead, question <code>0</code> is skipped and question <code>1</code> is solved, you will earn <code>4</code> points but you will be unable to solve questions <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>.
	
	


Return *the maximum points you can earn for the exam*.

 
Example 1:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: questions = [[3,2],[4,3],[4,4],[2,5]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The maximum points can be earned by solving questions 0 and 3.
- Solve question 0: Earn 3 points, will be unable to solve the next 2 questions
- Unable to solve questions 1 and 2
- Solve question 3: Earn 2 points
Total points earned: 3 + 2 = 5. There is no other way to earn 5 or more points.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: questions = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]]
Output: 7
Explanation: The maximum points can be earned by solving questions 1 and 4.
- Skip question 0
- Solve question 1: Earn 2 points, will be unable to solve the next 2 questions
- Unable to solve questions 2 and 3
- Solve question 4: Earn 5 points
Total points earned: 2 + 5 = 7. There is no other way to earn 7 or more points.
</pre>

 
Constraints:


	- <code>1 &lt;= questions.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
	- <code>questions[i].length == 2</code>
	- <code>1 &lt;= points<sub>i</sub>, brainpower<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
