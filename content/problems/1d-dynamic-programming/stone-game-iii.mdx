## Description
Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array <code>stoneValue</code>.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player&#39;s turn, that player can take <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, or <code>3</code> stones from the first remaining stones in the row.

The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The score of each player is <code>0</code> initially.

The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.

Return <code>&quot;Alice&quot;</code>* if Alice will win, *<code>&quot;Bob&quot;</code>* if Bob will win, or *<code>&quot;Tie&quot;</code>* if they will end the game with the same score*.

 
Example 1:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,7]
Output: &quot;Bob&quot;
Explanation: Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,-9]
Output: &quot;Alice&quot;
Explanation: Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win and leave Bob with negative score.
If Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob&#39;s score becomes 5. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and lose.
If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob&#39;s score becomes 3. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and also lose.
Remember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that makes her win.
</pre>

Example 3:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,6]
Output: &quot;Tie&quot;
Explanation: Alice cannot win this game. She can end the game in a draw if she decided to choose all the first three piles, otherwise she will lose.
</pre>

 
Constraints:


	- <code>1 &lt;= stoneValue.length &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
	- <code>-1000 &lt;= stoneValue[i] &lt;= 1000</code>
