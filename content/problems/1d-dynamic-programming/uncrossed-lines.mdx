## Description
You are given two integer arrays <code>nums1</code> and <code>nums2</code>. We write the integers of <code>nums1</code> and <code>nums2</code> (in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.

We may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting two numbers <code>nums1[i]</code> and <code>nums2[j]</code> such that:


	- <code>nums1[i] == nums2[j]</code>, and
	- the line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.


Note that a connecting line cannot intersect even at the endpoints (i.e., each number can only belong to one connecting line).

Return *the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way*.

 
Example 1:
<Image alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/04/26/142.png" width={400} height={286} />
<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: nums1 = [1,4,2], nums2 = [1,2,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram.
We cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from nums1[1] = 4 to nums2[2] = 4 will intersect the line from nums1[2]=2 to nums2[1]=2.
</pre>

Example 2:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: nums1 = [2,5,1,2,5], nums2 = [10,5,2,1,5,2]
Output: 3
</pre>

Example 3:

<br /><pre className="overflow-x-auto">
Input: nums1 = [1,3,7,1,7,5], nums2 = [1,9,2,5,1]
Output: 2
</pre>

 
Constraints:


	- <code>1 &lt;= nums1.length, nums2.length &lt;= 500</code>
	- <code>1 &lt;= nums1[i], nums2[j] &lt;= 2000</code>
